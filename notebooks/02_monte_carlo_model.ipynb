    "## Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process\n",
    "commonly used to model asset prices in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was introduced in the early 20th century and formally developed\n",
    "in the 1960s by Paul Samuelson, building on the mathematical work of\n",
    "Louis Bachelier, one of the pioneers of modern financial mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "GBM was designed to capture two key features of asset prices:\n",
    "- Randomness in price movements\n",
    "- Proportional (relative) price changes rather than absolute ones\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, GBM remains a foundational model in quantitative finance.\n",
    "It is widely used for:\n",
    "- Option pricing (e.g. Black–Scholes framework)\n",
    "- Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "- Risk analysis and stress testing\n",
    "- Educational and benchmarking purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity and unrealistic assumptions (such as **constant\n",
    "volatility**), GBM is still used as a first-order approximation due to its\n",
    "analytical tractability and intuitive interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined by the following stochastic differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**dS_t = μ S_t dt + σ S_t dW_t**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- S_t is the stock price\n",
    "- dt is a small time variation\n",
    "- dS_t is the price variation\n",
    "- μ is the expected return (drift)\n",
    "- σ is the volatility\n",
    "- W_t is a standard Brownian motion, whose increments follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance proportional to time.\n"

    "## Model Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The GBM model relies on the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns are log-normally distributed  \n",
    "  (This implies that prices remain strictly positive and that returns are modeled in relative terms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volatility is constant over the simulation horizon  \n",
    "  (This simplifies the model but ignores volatility clustering observed in real markets.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- No arbitrage opportunities  \n",
    "  (The model assumes that prices evolve in a way that prevents riskless profit.)\n",

    "\n",
    "For short-term risk analysis, the drift component μ has a limited impact\n",

    "\n",
    "The term W_t represents a standard Brownian motion, which introduces\n",
    "randomness into the price dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the Brownian motion starts at zero : W_0 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, its increments ( W_{t+dt} - W_t ) are:\n",
    "- normally distributed with mean 0\n",
    "- independent across time\n",
    "- with variance equal to the time increment ( dt )\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the Brownian motion is constructed by summing small random\n",
